Heart disease, a leading cause of mortality worldwide, encompasses various conditions that affect the heart's structure and function.
Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management, potentially reducing the risk of severe outcomes such as heart attacks or strokes.
In this diagnostic analysis, we aim to identify patterns and correlations within a dataset of patient health indicators to predict the presence of heart disease.
The dataset used in this analysis includes features such as age, sex, chest pain type,resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and more. 
By exploring these features,we aim to understand their relationships and how they contribute to the likelihood of heart disease. 
This analysis involves an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA),followed by the application of statistical methods and machine learning techniquesto build a predictive model.
